# cards

(Project inspired by drama [Alice in Borderland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49_44FFKZ1M))

This project will give you experience with searching and sorting
cards, which has an underlying ArrayList implementation. You will
also gain experience in reading and understanding code that has
already been implemented.

You are expected to finish implementing three methods in the class
Deck: linearSearch, selectionSort, and insertionSort. The method
binarySearch can be implemented as a bonus challenge.

You can test the correctness of your code by running the tests in
the test folder. There is also an interactive class, Game.java,
which allows you to create, sort, and shuffle through your own
Deck to help with debugging.

Let's play!
